## Running Locally

You must have nodjs installed: https://nodejs.org. Make sure Python 2 is installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/lupyanlab/TypicalityRatings
cd TypicalityRatings
npm install
npm start
```

When making changes, the html and javascript is in the `dev/` directory. To make sure the `prod/` (production) directory is
updated while editing the `dev/` directory, run the watch command.

```
npm run watch
```

If you just need to build `prod/` , then use this command:

```
npm run prod
```

Then, go to http://localhost:7071


## Switching from CSV to JSON and Vice Versa

Open `fileformat.js` and switch which file format you want the data and demographics in. You **must restart** the node api server (pm2) after making these changes.
